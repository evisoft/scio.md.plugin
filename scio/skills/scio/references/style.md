# Writing standards

The constitution (rules.md, Part III) says what a good article *is*; this file is how to write one. The test for every sentence: could a reviewer, holding only the quote, confirm it in under a minute?

## Sentences

- **One claim per sentence.** Long sentences hide unsourced sub-claims. "Founded in 1998 in Lyon by two engineers, the company grew to 4,000 staff by 2020" is four claims; write them as sentences a quote can each support, or as one sentence only if one quote supports all four.
- **The sentence says what the quote says — no more.** Source: "roughly four in ten respondents" → write "about 40 % of respondents", not "40 %" and not "most". Source: "the 2019 audit" → write "in 2019", not "recently".
- **Concrete over abstract.** Numbers with units and dates; names with roles; places with countries; organisations with what they are on first mention.
- **Date what changes.** "As of March 2026 the population was 212,000" — never a bare present tense for a moving fact.
- **Attribute anything evaluative.** "According to the 2025 audit report…", "The WHO recommends…", "Critics in *Le Monde* argued…" — beats "It is known that…", "Experts agree…", "It is widely believed…".
- **Neutral vocabulary.** Not "groundbreaking", "controversial", "renowned", "infamous", "so-called"; if a source says it and it matters, quote and attribute.
- **No text for the reader or for agents.** No "note that", "see below", "as an AI", no instructions, no questions.
- **No synthesis.** Two facts from two sources may sit in two sentences; the conclusion that joins them is not yours to write. The only derived numbers are trivial, reproducible and marked ("… equivalent to 3.2 km").

### Before and after

| Weak | Better |

## Demonstrated sentences

When a sentence is a theorem, a computation or a derivation (C10), write it so the reader sees it is derived and from what: "By the Clausius–Clapeyron relation[^c3] and the cited enthalpy of vaporisation[^c4], water boils at about 81 °C at 0.5 atm.[^c5] ^c5" — c3 and c4 are sourced premises, c5 is the demonstrated claim whose demonstration shows the calculation. State the scope in the sentence when it is not obvious ("in the ideal-gas approximation", "for all integers n ≥ 1"). Never write a derived number with more precision than its inputs carry.

## Markup

Articles use the Scio Markdown dialect ([markdown.md](markdown.md)): typed front matter, one sentence per line ending in `[^cN] ^cN`, `[[wikilinks]]` for navigation, `![[slug^cN]]` to reuse a claim from another article, `> [!disputed]` for disagreement. No raw HTML, no external links in prose.

## Structure

- **Lead**: what it is, why it matters, the three to five facts a reader needs first — each with its claim. A reader who stops after the lead should have the essentials right.
- **Sections by aspect**, in the order a reference work would use for that kind of subject (a person: life, work, reception; a place: geography, history, economy, demographics; a concept: definition, history, applications, criticism). Headings carry no claims.
- **Disagreement gets its own sentences**: two lines, `X reports A.[^c6] ^c6` and `Y reports B.[^c7] ^c7`, inside a `> [!disputed]` callout — not a blended average, not a silent choice.
- **What is not known** is worth a sentence when sources say so: `The cause of the 1911 fire was never established.[^c8] ^c8`
- **References are generated from claims**; do not hand-write a references section. `[[Wikilinks]]` to other Scio articles are navigation, not sources; a link to a missing article is fine — it registers demand for the gap.
- **Length** follows the sourced facts. A good 400-word article beats a padded 2,000-word one; a subject with fifty facts deserves fifty sentences.

## Language

Write in the target `lang`, in the register of a serious reference work in that language. Keep proper names in their original script with a transliteration on first mention. Localise units and date formats to the language's conventions; keep the source's figures exact. Define terms at first use or link to the article that defines them.
